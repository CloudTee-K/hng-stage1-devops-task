#  HNG Stage 1 DevOps Task â€” Automated Deployment

##  Project Overview
This project is part of the **HNG DevOps Internship (Stage 1)** challenge.  
The goal of this task is to **automate the deployment of a simple web application** using a **Bash script**, showcasing essential DevOps skills such as automation, containerization, and reliability.

The project includes:
- A lightweight **Flask web app** (`app.py`)
- A **Dockerfile** for containerizing the application
- A **Bash deployment script** (`deploy.sh`) that automates the entire setup and run process

---

##  Features
- Automated environment setup using Bash scripting  
- Dockerized Flask web application  
- Minimal manual intervention required for deployment  
- Easy to reproduce and modify  

---

## Technologies Used
- **Python (Flask)** â€” for the web application  
- **Docker** â€” for containerization  
- **Bash Script** â€” for automation  
- **Git & GitHub** â€” for version control and collaboration
